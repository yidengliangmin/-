QuestDB is a relational column-oriented database designed for real-time
analytics on time series and event data. It uses the SQL language with some
extensions for time series. This documentation will help you to get familiar
with QuestDB.

## Concepts

This section describes the architecture of QuestDB, how it stores and queries
data, and introduces features and capabilities specific to QuestDB.

As a start, we suggest you read about the
[storage model](/docs/concept/storage-model/) and about the
[designated timestamp](/docs/concept/designated-timestamp/). To make the most of
QuestDB, you should also get familiar with our
[SQL extensions](/docs/concept/sql-extensions/) which allow to make the most of
time series capabilities with an efficient non-verbose syntax. You will also
find the [symbol](/docs/concept/symbol/) concept interesting to store and
retrieve repetitive strings efficiently.

## Get started

This section explains how to install and run QuestDB. There are dedicated pages
for [Docker](/docs/get-started/docker/), the
[binaries](/docs/get-started/binaries/) or
[Homebrew](/docs/get-started/homebrew/). Once QuestDB is running you can follow
the guide to [create your first database](/docs/get-started/first-database/).

## Develop

In this section you will learn how to [connect](/docs/develop/connect/) to
QuestDB using popular tools and languages. Importing and/or inserting data are
both covered in the [insert data](/docs/develop/insert-data/) page. Finally, you
can check the [query data](/docs/develop/query-data/) page in order to run your
queries.

## Third-party tools

- [Grafana](/docs/third-party-tools/grafana/) instructions for connecting QuestDB as a datasource for building visualizations and dashboards
- [Kafka](/docs/third-party-tools/kafka/) guide for ingesting data from topics into QuestDB by means of Kafka Connect
- [Telegraf](/docs/third-party-tools/telegraf/) guide for collecting system metrics, specifying QuestDB as an output and visualizing the results

## Operations

This section contains resources for managing QuestDB instances and has dedicated
pages for the following topics:

- [Deployment](/docs/operations/deployment/) details with information for
  running locally, on Kubernetes or the AWS AMI
- [Data retention](/docs/operations/data-retention/) strategy to delete old data
  and save disk space
- [Health monitoring](/docs/operations/health-monitoring/) endpoint for
  determining the status of the instance
